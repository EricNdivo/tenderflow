# TenderFlow Backend Implementation Summary

This document provides an overview of the Supabase backend implementation for TenderFlow.

## Files Created/Modified

1. **Authentication Services**:
   - `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration
   - `src/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication service functions (sign up, sign in, sign out)
   - `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Custom hook for authentication state management
   - `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Auth context provider for React components

2. **Database Schema**:
   - `supabase/schema.sql` - SQL schema for creating tables and security policies
   - `supabase/README.md` - Instructions for setting up Supabase backend

3. **API Utilities**:
   - `src/lib/api.ts` - Generic utilities for working with Supabase data

4. **Component Updates**:
   - `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Route protection for authenticated users
   - `src/pages/Login.tsx` - Connected to auth service
   - `src/pages/Register.tsx` - Connected to auth service
   - `src/App.tsx` - Added auth provider and protected routes

## Database Tables Created

1. **profiles** - User profile information
   - Connected to auth.users
   - Stores user details (name, company, etc.)

2. **tenders** - Tender listings
   - Stores tender information
   - Has RLS policies to control access

3. **applications** - Tender applications
   - For users to apply to tenders
   - Links users to tenders

4. **purchase_orders** - Purchase orders
   - For creating and tracking orders

5. **po_items** - Purchase order line items
   - Individual items in purchase orders

6. **sourcing_requests** - Requests for sourcing products
   - For users to request specific items to be sourced

## Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
2. **Security Policies** to control data access:
   - Users can only view and edit their own data
   - Published tenders are publicly viewable
   - Admin roles can be implemented for special access

3. **Storage Buckets**:
   - Public bucket for profile avatars
   - Private bucket for sensitive documents

## Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up**:
   - User provides credentials and profile information
   - Account created in auth.users
   - Profile created in profiles table
   - User redirected to dashboard

2. **Sign In**:
   - User provides email and password
   - Supabase validates credentials
   - User redirected to dashboard or requested page

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - Routes like dashboard, tender-application, po-application protected
   - Unauthenticated users redirected to login

## Next Steps

1. Implement specific service functions for:
   - Tenders CRUD operations
   - Applications management
   - Purchase orders workflow
   - Sourcing requests

2. Create UI components for:
   - User profile management
   - Dashboard data visualization
   - Tender application forms
   - Purchase order creation

3. Add more advanced features:
   - Email notifications
   - File uploads for documents
   - Admin dashboard for management

## Best Practices Used

1. **Type Safety** - TypeScript types used throughout
2. **Error Handling** - Consistent error handling patterns
3. **State Management** - React context for auth state
4. **Security** - RLS policies to secure data
5. **Code Organization** - Clean separation of concerns
